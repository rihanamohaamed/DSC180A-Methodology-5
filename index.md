**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?** <br>
The most interesting topic that was covered during my capstone was the domain in general. The entire quarter we were told to replicate a paper on sepsis. The domain knowledge we have gathered and the amount of analysis we were able to do on this type of data was really cool.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.** <br>
I think in quarter 2 project I want to try to do something where we take new data and try to utilize multimorbidity to predict something else. Right now it is closely corrlated to sepsis 
**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?** <br>
There isn't much that I would change in my approach. I think one thing I wish I changed is my group of 4 split up the work for the different analysis and different algorithms used for prediction and grouping. I wish we started on that a little earlier. It also got a little confusing when the data wasn't aligning with what the article said. 
**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
In this project I want to try to incorporate more algorithm that can do something where data is inputted and an outcome is established. Instead of just doing analytics related things I want to create something that would help patients with different data.
