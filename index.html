Section A05: Kyle Shannon 

 <strong>What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?</strong>
The most interesting topic that was covered during my capstone was the domain in general. The entire quarter we were told to replicate a paper on sepsis. The domain knowledge we have gathered and the amount of analysis we were able to do on this type of data was really cool. 
<strong>Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.</strong>
What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?
